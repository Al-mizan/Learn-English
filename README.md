# Learn-English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©

## Project Overview

Learn-English is an interactive language learning application built with Tkinter that helps users learn English vocabulary through an engaging visual learning method. The application displays English words and their Bangla translations in a timed, sequential manner to facilitate language learning.

## Key Features

- **Bilingual Word Display**: Shows English words followed by their Bangla translations
- **Automatic Translation**: Automatically switches between English and Bangla after a 3-second interval
- **Tkinter GUI**: Simple and intuitive graphical user interface
- **Continuous Learning Loop**: Repeats the word display process to reinforce learning

## Known Issues

The current version experiences font rendering issues with Bangla text, which may affect the visual presentation of translations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Tkinter library (typically comes pre-installed with Python)
- A font that supports Bangla script (e.g., SolaimanLipi, Kalpurush)
